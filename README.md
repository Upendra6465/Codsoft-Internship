# Codsoft Machine Learning Internship

During my internship at Codsoft, I focused on practical applications of machine learning by completing a series of projects. Below are the details of the tasks I successfully completed:

## 1. Movie Genre Classification
- **Objective:** Develop a model to classify movies into genres based on their descriptions.
- **Approach:**
  - Implemented and fine-tuned various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
  - Used TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction.
  - Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

## 2. Credit Card Fraud Detection
- **Objective:** Build a predictive model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions.
- **Approach:**
  - Preprocessed the dataset to handle imbalanced classes using techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).
  - Explored and applied algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
  - Evaluated model effectiveness using precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

## 3. Spam SMS Detection
- **Objective:** Create a model to detect and filter out spam SMS messages.
- **Approach:**
  - Applied Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to clean and process the text data.
  - Used Naive Bayes, SVM, and Logistic Regression algorithms for classification.
  - Evaluated performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
